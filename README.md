City Kit
========
####For you to find things you never looked for

City Kit was developed at the 24 hour Startup hackathon hosted by the City of Kitchener. This started off as a web app that was initially targetted towards tourists or new residents of the Kitchener/Waterloo area who want to explore the city and what it has to offer. Since it was more of an "entrepreneur" focused hackathon, we were required to have a sustainable business plan. So we improved the conventional advertising techniques, greatly. Most of what our app had was an embedded Google map that pulled data from Kitchener's open-data database, we took advantage of that and innovated geolocalized advertisements. Instead of the usual ad embeddings around the page, our advertisements would be put on the map itself. This would easily show the user where exactly the business is. We also pulled data from Red Flag Deals and Groupon so that the user can also benefit from using the app by finding deals around him/herself really fast without any inconveniences.
